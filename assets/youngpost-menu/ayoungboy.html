                It can be said that the global music market is undergoing huge changes in the past 10 years. Most prominent is the fact that rap hip hop has become the most listened to genre, occupying many important positions or reputation rankings from 2017 until now and one of the individuals driving these changes to take place strongly. So strong is Post malone. Kicking off your career with catchy melodies with White
                 Iverson and then moving on to Flex songs full of personality 
                 in HollywoodBleeding. 
                 All of this has helped Posty become the artist with the most streams, 
                 even surpassing the legendary Michael Jackson by owning an album with 
                 the number of weeks at the top of the Billboard chart surpassing even 
                 the sacred album Thriller.

                Few people could imagine that the guy with a silly appearance, who likes to drink mango beer and dance on stage, 
                would have such a dream career. So how did post malone start his career, 
                what is so special about his music that makes the whole world so addicted? 
                Is Posy the face that changed the world of global hiphop, and most importantly, is the genre he plays hiphop or melodic rap or is it simply singing?
